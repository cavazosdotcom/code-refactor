## What I changed

The main changes to the html I made was making sure the anchor links were all working, so I added the missing id. I also added alt tags to all the images as well.

In the css, I made many more changes. I removed some unnecesarry code that was reused in multiple locations and made them into singular classes. I also rearranged the content and benefit sections so they would be next to eachother instead of jumbled around
